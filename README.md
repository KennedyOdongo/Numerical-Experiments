Typically, the concerns of Machine Learning Algorithms vastly differ from econometric methods even though the methods that are used are very similar. In Econometrics we concern ourselves with the robustness of estimates, consistency,unbiasedness etc. In ML the focus is typically on space and time constraints, estimation speed etc. The purpose of this repo is to compare and contrast these methods using numerical experiments
